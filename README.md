# Figero

Currently on the top of my backlog, Figero started out as a hackathon project aiming to solve the achilles heel of the INFJ--mindful self care via regular externalization and processing of emotions/feelings. The 'counselor' of the Meyers Briggs personality types, mindful self care is ironically a constant struggle as our focus is on the emotional support of others--we have to work very hard to learn to wear our hearts on our sleeves (or at least have a semblence of understanding of what the hell is going on in there). 

Protoyped as a PWA leveraging the lightweight MoodPatrol API, Figero was made to be a journal with a brain that would thoughtfully respond to entries with questions as well as prompt for further emotional processing and general checkins throughout the day. The next iteration will pivot to mobile only via React Native and will go deeper into AI via the IBM Watson API. Eventually there will also be a bot moderated forum where users can connect with like minded people and build mindful support systems.
